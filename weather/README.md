## Project Structure

## Data Processing

Data collected consists of one station from Seattle, 01-01-2018 to 12-31-2022 and of 68 stations in Springfield over same dates.

For ease of comparison, we have cleaned the data to consist of only one station's worth of records from both cities. Several dates from each city over the five year period were missing; these have complemented by the average precipitation for that day of the year for that city. Both datasets were combined into one final source.
