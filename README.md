## Data Processing

Data consists of precipitation collected at one station in Seattle, WA, 01-01-2018 to 12-31-2022, and at 68 stations in Springfield, OR over the same dates.

For ease of comparison, I have cleaned the data to consist of only one station's worth of records from both cities. Precipitation values for several dates from each city over the five year period were missing; these have complemented by the mean average precipitation for that day of the year for that city. Both data sets were combined into one final source.
